This project uses Typescript, which transpiles into Javascript and is easier to wrap your head around if you are used to stricter languages. Typechecking is cool!

## Setup

`npm install` in the project directory should be sufficient (update this if not)

## Scripts

`npm run start` or `npm start` to build and make an express server.

`npm run build` to build the Typescript files into JavaScript

`npm run lint` is broken but will lint the TypeScript

`npm run clean` will clean out the build folder
